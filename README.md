# PHP object browser for the Booosta Framework

This module provides a class, that visualizes an Object with all data including arrays and sub objects.
It can be configured to provide custom links for manipulating this object.

Despite this is a module of the Booosta Framework, it can be also used standalone. See the `example` folder
for usage. The output is HTML, so you need to call the example script via web browser.

data objects can be seen as the Vs and Ms of MVC.
